# AUTO-07-Update-to-Python-3.0
the code for auto is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/auto-07p/files/

Professor Broderick says

"I am looking for someone to work updating a piece of open source software (AUTO)
which is currently written in Python. The work will involve ensuring that the software
works with the latest versions of Python and associated libraries (matplotlib, numpy etc)
and on different operating systems (linux and OS X). The code will then be added to the
software repository and properly documented so that other researchers around the world
can use it. "

This mainly works on Python 2.7, needs to be updated to 3.0.

There is a bug in mplotlab(?), can only run below and including version 1.5.

Fix the zooming problem first, worry about Python 3 later.
